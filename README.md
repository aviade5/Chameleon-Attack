# Chameleon-Attack

Online social networks (OSNs) are ubiquitous attracting millions of users all over the world. 
Being a popular communication media OSNs are exploited in a variety of cyber attacks. 
In this project, we discuss the *chameleon* attack technique, a new type of OSN-based trickery, where malicious posts and profiles change the way they are displayed to OSN users to conceal themselves before the attack or avoid detection.

## Online Social Network Admin Responses:

### Twitter

Thank you for your report.
This behavior has been reported to us previously, and while it may not be ideal, at this time, we do not believe this poses
more of a risk than the ability to tweet a URL of any kind since the content of any web page may also change without
warning. Thankfully we do have other security controls that limit malicious behavior. For example, our t.co URL
shortener checks every URL posted in Tweet against our database of potentially harmful URLs and will warn users if they
are navigating to a known malicious URL. We appreciate you taking the time to submit this and encourage you to
continue searching for vulnerabilities.
Thank you for thinking of Twitter security.
