# Chamelon-Attack

Online social networks (OSNs) are ubiquitous attracting millions of users all over the world. 
Being a popular communication media OSNs are exploited in a variety of cyber attacks. 
In this project, we discuss the Chameleon attack technique, a new type of OSN-based trickery, where malicious posts and profiles change the way they are displayed to OSN users to conceal themselves before the attack or avoid detection.
